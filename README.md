# TODO - Write ReadMe
TnoSQL is a toy noSQL database API for C++.
It is based on one written for my senior design project the repo for which was, unfortunately, left private by my professor.

The API is header only, so just needs the directory be placed within the include path of a project, and the main tnosql.h header included by the preprocessor.

TnoSQL is based on JSON as a document format and will support both in-memory and real-time-parsed documents to support varying requirements
